###Background
The history of the Golden State Warriors began in Philadelphia in 1946. It was first relocated to San Francisco, California and became known as the San Francisco Warriors until 1971, when its name was changed to the current Golden State Warriors. Along with their inaugural championship win in the 1946–47 season, the Warriors have won five others in the team's history, including another in Philadelphia after the 1955–56 season, and four more as Golden State after the 1974–75, 2014–15, 2016–17, and 2017–18 seasons. The Warriors won the inaugural Basketball Association of America (BAA) championship in 1947, and won its second championship in 1956, led by Hall of Fame trio Paul Arizin, Tom Gola, and Neil Johnston. However, the Warriors would not return to similar heights in Philadelphia, and after a brief rebuilding period following the trade of star Wilt Chamberlain, the team moved to San Francisco. With star players Jamaal Wilkes and Rick Barry, the Warriors returned to title contention, and won their third championship in 1975, in what is largely considered one of the biggest upsets in NBA history.

The dots mean the player attempted a shot, blue means a shot was successful and red means the player missed the shot. Among the five players Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson made the most shots. Stephen Curry has the point guard position which means he would defense and would try to keep the ball on the side of his team.

```  

###Shot Type Total and Made % by Players
This data shows that Curry made the most three-point field goals. All other players were stuck with the two-point field goals.

Names <- c("Andre Iguodala", "Draymond Green", "Kevin Durant" , "Klay Thompson", " Stephen Curry")

Total <- c(length(iguodala$shot_made_flag),length(green$shot_made_flag),length(durant$shot_made_flag),length(klay$shot_made_flag),length(curry$shot_made_flag))

made <- rbind(sum(iguodala$shot_made_flag == "y"),sum(green$shot_made_flag == "y"),sum(durant$shot_made_flag == "y"),sum(klay$shot_made_flag == "y"),sum(curry$shot_made_flag == "y"))

perc_made <- c(made/Total)

df1 <- data.frame(Names, Total, made, perc_made)
df1 <- df1[order(-perc_made),]
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
df1
