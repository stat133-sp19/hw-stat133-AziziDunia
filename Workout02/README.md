# Workout02

In this workout, students create a shiny app that allows them to visualize-in an interactive way-some of the saving/investing scenarios that we previously worked on our warmup06 for this class. The idea is to implement an app for the saving-investing modalities descriped in our section 4 of lab warmup6. These scenarios are the three mode of investing which is the future value of an investment (without any additional contributions), with annuity, and with growing annuity.
